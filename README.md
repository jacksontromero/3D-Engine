# 3D-Engine
Rudimentary 3D graphics in Java

This project implements 3D rendering at its most basic level in Java

Download and run 3D.jar in to play around with the program

## Features

* Can show any shape defined as points and edges (but right now just Cubes and Tetrahedrons are implemented)

* Can add translation, rotation, and scale animations with configurable parameters like speed and start time

* Can apply different animations to different objects 

* Can play/pause all animations

### Notes

Window is 750x750 so the center is at (375,375)

Objects in front of the camera are on the -Z axis, so in order to see new objects make sure that they are are values with -Z
